# React’s Effect Hooks

## useEffect

**When it runs:**  
Runs last - after the component has committed to the DOM (after painting).

**Use case:**  
For side effects that don’t block visual updates (e.g., data fetching, subscribing to events, or updating state when it’s not time-critical for layout consistency).

---

## useLayoutEffect

**When it runs:**  
Runs synchronously right after DOM mutations but **before** the browser paints.

**Use case:**  
Great for operations that require reading or measuring the DOM (e.g., obtaining layout measurements) and then synchronously updating the UI _before_ the browser repaints.

> **Note:** It blocks painting while it executes, so overusing it can affect perceived performance.

---

## useInsertionEffect

**When it runs:**  
Runs even earlier than `useLayoutEffect`, during the “commit” phase of rendering.

**Use case:**  
Designed specifically for injecting CSS and style-related side effects (often used by CSS-in-JS libraries) so that styles are in place before the DOM is updated. It’s **not** typically intended for general state updates or other side effects.

## Which Makes Most Sense in This Scenario?

Your goal is to **force a sorting update on mount** for your table by updating the internal state (i.e. calling `table.setSorting(...)`) so that the sorted row model reflects your initial state. Consider the following:

useInsertionEffect

- **Note:** This hook is meant for inserting styles. Using it here (for non-style-related state synchronization) is atypical and could lead to unexpected behavior because it fires before DOM mutations are committed.

useLayoutEffect

- **Note:** While you could use this hook to force the sorting update synchronously before the browser paints (which might help avoid some intermediate flickers), it may be overkill and could delay painting if the sorting logic isn’t trivial.

useEffect

- **Note:** In many cases, a plain `useEffect` is sufficient—especially if the sorting state change doesn’t need to block the initial paint. Since updating the sorting state isn’t directly tied to DOM reads/writes (just the table’s internal state), `useEffect` is the most natural choice.

---

### Recommendation

For forcing your table’s sorting state update on mount, **`useEffect`** is the most appropriate hook. It keeps your UI responsive by not blocking the paint, and the sorting update is not stalling any critical DOM measurements.

### Example -

```typescript
import { useEffect } from "react";
// Inside your DataTable component:
useEffect(() => {
  // Force re-apply sorting on mount if an initial sort state is provided.
  if (initialState?.sorting) {
    table.setSorting(initialState.sorting);
  }
}, []); // runs once after the component mounts
```

**Use this over `useLayoutEffect` or `useInsertionEffect` unless you have a specific need to update the sorting state synchronously before the browser paints.**

---

### Final Thoughts

- **`useEffect`**: Most common and sufficient for state updates (like sorting).
- **`useLayoutEffect`**: For effects requiring immediate DOM reads/writes before painting.
- **`useInsertionEffect`**: Reserved solely for early CSS/style insertions.

For your case, stick with **`useEffect`** to keep things clear and maintain a responsive UI without unnecessary paint blocking.
